# PandemicInfo - Covid 19
Using the HTML , CSS and JS tried to make a wesite which show's the numeric data of covid cases of places in a world map . For world map we used a public API which embed's the world map to the website, We use a data.js file in which the numeric data is feeded from js we inlcuded it and plotted on the world map 

## Hosted by github pages

* It does not have any backend functionality
* The data doesnot updates realtime since it is fetched by json file
